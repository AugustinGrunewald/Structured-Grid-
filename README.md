# Structured Grid
General class for modeling “4-sided” domains and structured grids on them. Cpp short project during my studies at KTH.
Files : timer.hpp and plotdomain.py were given for the project.

# Instruction for compiling
g++ -std=c ++17 -Wall -o main main.cpp grid.cpp
./main

You can use the plotdomain.py file to plot the results generated by the executable and saved in the txt files.

# Maths behind
See the pdf report to get a bit of the math behind this grid generation !

# Example of results
Here is an example of the results you could obtain for two differents 4 sides domains.
